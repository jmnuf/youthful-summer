## Plot Setup
The group of friends are spending summer in Dirvir’s island. They have come together to spend some time feeling youthful as adult hood is slowly creeping onto them and already around the corner. The group will search for ways to squeeze out that last moment of youth from their early 20s as they are all finishing college. Some secrets still remain between them and Tier is looking to have a most enjoyable time and maybe uncover one or two of the secrets. Unknown to everyone but Dirvir, this summer break has been looping for quite a few times because of Tier’s feeling of unfull-fillingness and her subconsciously winding back time erasing everyone’s memories. Telling Tier about this won’t help the situation and could make it worse, so Meiu, Dirvir and Pliu will have to make sure to satisfy Tier’s wims and fight against her just enough to escape this loop!

## Plot Progression Events

### Introduction
The group of friends arrive onto the touristic island, Yerm Um. Which is very big island were they will be spending the last month of summer trying to just make the most of it. Here you get an introduction to the main cast and you learn about your aim at night as Dirvir pulls the player (Meiu) and Pliu aside to mention the effects on the timeline which seem to have resets unconsciously done by Tier. Dirvir brought everyone to the island in hopes of breaking the loop but it still keeps happening so she’s now requesting help. The only way to break it is to fulfill Tier’s wish of an unforgettable and perfect summer end.

### First Event: Bike riding
To get to know the island's places Pliu suggests going on a bike tour around the town. Dirvir provides the bicycles through a request to the branch of the main household in the island. You are able to ride your bike and converse with your friends to gain favorability and also keep Tier entertained.
Within this event is the one where you can gather more information about what Tier expects to see and what whims you can fulfill more easily. After this one you will have very small clues to know whether she is entertained or not.

### Activity Events
All the following events can be done in any order and they won't affect one another much if at all, swimming, scenery watching, beach volleyball and hiking. All of the events will have a pre-event stage, an on-event stage, and a post-event stage. During these events you can connect with the cast and try to make it memorable.

### Time Reset
After doing the entire set of events once, you will be thrown back to the introduction with a random number of iterations added to the dialog as to say that many more times you have repeated this sequence.

### Time Loop Breaking
After resetting once you can break the loop by remembering you still have to work on a paper for college and requesting help with it. Though just doing this isn't enough, you must in this section recapitulate some events of the summer to solidify the memories and maybe confess to one of your friends (Optional idea might not make it in).

# Saving
## Autosave
The game will autosave on each end of a section, like after the introduction or completing a subsection of an event.

## Manual Saving
The player will be able to manually save when wanting as long as they are not in a mini-game (Unsure if we will actually add mini-games)
